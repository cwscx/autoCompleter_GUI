GitHub for the project:
	https://github.com/cwscx/autoCompleter_GUI

To TAs: When testing with code from PA3Deploy branch, move 
skeleton / solution code into the current folder. For a 
function showcase version, check CleanSlate branch.



Compiling the binary is as simple as running
    > qmake AutoCreator.pro
    > make

For windows, assuming you are working a Qt with MinGW, run 
    > mingw32-make
instead of make.

Notice that in skeleton PA3 code, one shall add a line to 
return an empty vector in MWF::predictCompletions(). Other-
wise the GUI would crash upon typing first character because
the GUI received a undefined object from prefictCompletions().
