   If you are looking at this version of doc, this is a probably deployable
   version of GUI after you:
   1. Check AutoCreator.pro that necessary files are referenced.
   2. Check the function signature of predictCompletions called in wordlist

   WOOOOOOOOOOOOW

Compiling the binary is as simple as running
    > qmake AutoCreator.pro #Note: Version of Qt matters. Use the one in
                             /software/common64/qt-5.5.0/bin
    > make

For windows, assuming you are working a Qt with MinGW, run 
    > mingw32-make
instead of make.

On my Windows system I had to move a couple .dll-s from Qt's bin
folder to the one where the binary resides. Not sure if we need 
this step for Linux/Mac.
