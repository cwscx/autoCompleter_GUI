To TA: 
    There are three branches on repo now:
    Master, CleanSlate, and PA3Deploy
    Master and CleanSlate is probably the same and they have
    showcase code to demonstrate that basic functionalities are 
    working.
    PA3Deploy has a modified AutoCreator.pro to compile with PA3
    code. Please move PA3 skeleton/solution code in when testing.


Compiling the binary is as simple as running
    > qmake AutoCreator.pro
    > make

For windows, assuming you are working a Qt with MinGW, run 
    > mingw32-make
instead of make.

On my Windows system I had to move a couple .dll-s from Qt's bin
folder to the one where the binary resides. Not sure if we need 
this step for Linux/Mac.

Notice that in skeleton PA3 code, one shall add a line to 
return an empty vector in MWF::predictCompletions(). Other-
wise the GUI would crash upon typing first character because
the GUI received a undefined object from prefictCompletions().
